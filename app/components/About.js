                Ever since I was little I had a fascination with computers and software in particular.
                Looking to expand my horizons and network with a job opportunity where I can grow my skills through hands-on-learning, development work and collaboration with the team . I have previous experience as an IT consultant at Global Scales. Inc and wish to improve my software development proficiency, I am adept at Web development languages along with C++, C and Java. I am a team player and value collaboration and communication above all else.
